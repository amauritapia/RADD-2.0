The application will provide statistics for Dota 2 Heros on their win rate, popular item builds, and other heroes that they synergize/counter.  There is also a plan to include match history for a user logged in through the Steam API. If possible we will also implement the features to be called by a discord bot by using the "!heroName" command in discord. The target audience for this application will those that play Dota 2. It will fulfill these conditions by grabbing the information from our database and running calculations internally to get the final results to be displayed.
